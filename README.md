This project is for the DCSWorld F18 Radar Altimeter. I've adapted the Open Hornet bezel from the Fusion 360 project to cover the display.
The rotary encoder to push to test and setting the Min Height is connected to a seperate Arduino Mega and its inputs are handled by it.    

I've included STL files to print a mountiong base for the display and the Bezel.

Its important to set the IDE up for the LCD Display. I've included a screenshot of my settings.
The board selected is the "ESP32S3 DEV Module"
